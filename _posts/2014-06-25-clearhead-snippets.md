Why Hello! I'm Tom Fuertes, the "new" Director of Engineering at Clearhead. Nice to meet you!  I'm using my intro to the company post to announce a new public repo of snippets and patterns we use often here at Clearhead. 

## clearhead-snippets: A collection of experiment helper functions.

Googling through “site:stackoverflow.com” and frustratedly parsing through un-linked code between arguments of jquery vs vanilla javascript is a thing of the past!  Pop open Clearhead Snippets anytime you need code around:

* getting and setting cookies
* getting values from query params
* loading external js with a callback

[https://github.com/clearhead/clearhead-snippets](https://github.com/clearhead/clearhead-snippets)

The current code is quality, but the repository is still in flux. Future plans include howtos/patterns around avoiding test flicker, manual experiment activation, and more.

If you're a front-end engineer interested in AB testing, please use the [Contact Us Form](http://clearhead.me/#contact-nav) - we're hiring!

-Tom
